# LINUX SHELL SCRIPTING (CONTROL FLOWS)
 To demonstrate control flows, I ran a script which asks for a number and then tells us whether the number is positive, negative or zero

 I created a file and put the first line of script in it 
 ![](./vi-cat.png)

 I gave execute permissions and ran the script. The script asked me to enter a number and nothing else happened
 ![](./chmod-run.png)
 
 I then added a second line of script
 ![](./vi-cat2.png)
 I ran the script
 ![](./run00.png)

 I then added the if statement to execute commands based on conditions
 ![](./vi-cat3.png)
 ![](./run3.png)

 I added the else if statement and input a negative number

 ## LOOPS
 For loops, I practised the List form and the C-style loop
 In the list form , I practiced a basic and range syntax loop styles

 I create 2 scripts for each style of the List format and input the scripts

 Basic syntax

 ![](./run%20basic.png)

Range syntax
![](./vi-cat-syntax.png)
![](./run-syntax.png)

For the C loop, I also created a script
