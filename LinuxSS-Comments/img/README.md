# LINUX SHELL SCRIPTING (COMMENTS)

I practiced single line commenting, commenting after a command and multiple single line commenting

## Single Line Commenting
I created the shell script and commented in it
![](./create%20script.png)

I gave execute permissions and ran the script
![](./chmod%20and%20run.png)

I ran a script that prints a welcome message, create a directory, lists the files in the files in the current directory and displays a goodbye message
![](./vi%20new.png)
![](./ls%20and%20run.png)

## Multiple Single Line Comments
I created the shell script and commented in it
![](./create%20multi.png)

I gave execute permissions and ran the script
![](./chmod-run-multi.png)
