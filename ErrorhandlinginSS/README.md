# Error Handling in Shell Scripting

Error handling is a crucial aspect of scripting that involves anticipating and managing errors that may occur during script execution. These errors could arise from various factors such as incorrect user input, unexpected system behaviour or resource unavailability. Proper error handling is essential for improving the reliability, robustness and usability of shell scripts.

## Implementing Error Handling
When implementing error handling in shell scripting, it is essential to consider various scenarios and develop strategies to handle them effectively.

First, begin by identifying potential sources of errors in the  script and anticipating scenarios where errors may occur. These errors could include input validation, command execution or file operations.

Then, Utilize conditional statements (if,elif, else) to check for error conditions and respond accordingly. Also, evaluate the exit status ($?) of commands to determine whether they executed successfully or not

## Handling S3 bucket errors
When creating S3 buckets, an error scenario could arise if the bucket already exists when attempting to create it. To handle this error, we can run a script to check if the bucket exists before attempting to create it. If it already exists, we can display a message indicating that the bucket is already present.

# Function to create S3 buckets for different departments
create_s3_buckets() {"\n    company=\"datawise\"\n    departments=(\"Marketing\" \"Sales\" \"HR\" \"Operations\" \"Media\")\n    \n    for department in \"${departments[@]"}"; do
        bucket_name="${company}-${department}-Data-Bucket"
        
        # Check if the bucket already exists
        if aws s3api head-bucket --bucket "$bucket_name" &>/dev/null; then
            echo "S3 bucket '$bucket_name' already exists."
        else
            # Create S3 bucket using AWS CLI
            aws s3api create-bucket --bucket "$bucket_name" --region your-region
            if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
                echo "S3 bucket '$bucket_name' created successfully."
            else
                echo "Failed to create S3 bucket '$bucket_name'."
            fi
        fi
    done
}
