## Git Version Control System

In this project, I showcased how git is used as a tool to help people work together on projects by using the different git commands

### Github 
I used github as central repository

### Git version
I verified the installation of git by running the git --version command

### Git Clone
Git clone was used to download the project from Github, a central repository to my local machine

### Git Status
I used the git status command to check what files are yet to be staged and committed

### Git add and Git commit
After making changes to the repository, I added the file to the staging area by running git add and also took a snapshot of it by running git commit

### Git push
After commiting, I pushed the changes to my remote repository by running the command git push

### Github repository url
I created a repository with an index.html file at it's root
