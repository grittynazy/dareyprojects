# LINUX SHELL SCRIPTING (MINI)
I practices some how to create a shell script, give execute permissions and run the script on the terminal.

First, I created a folder, entered into it and wrote a script to create some folders and users
![](./mkdir%20shell-scripting.png)
![](./cd-vi.png)

To confirm that the file indeed was created, I ran ls -latr command
![](./ls%20-latr.png)

I executed the file without giving the execute permissions and I got a permission error
![](./permission%20denied.png)

I then assigned the execute permission to the user
![](./chmod.png)

Then I ran the script
![](./run%20script.png)

I ensured the folders where created using the ls command and the users were created using the id command
![](./ls.png)
![](./id.png)

## Variable Declaration and Initialization
I assigned a value to a variable and retrieved the value from the variable using the echo command
